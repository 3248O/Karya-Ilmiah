# CRISPR/Cas9 for Thalassemia Treatment in Indonesia

## What is this?

A scientific research paper examining CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology as a potential future treatment for thalassemia in Indonesia. Analyzes the biological effectiveness, social impact, and economic feasibility of using CRISPR to treat beta-thalassemia compared to traditional treatment methods.
## Short summary

- **High prevalence**: Indonesia reports 2,500+ new thalassemia cases annually, making it one of the most common genetic blood disorders in the country
- **Indonesia's location**: Situated in the "thalassemia belt" covering from Europe to Southeast Asia
- **Current treatment burden**: Patients require lifelong blood transfusions (24x/year) and iron chelation therapy, severely impacting quality of life
- **Promising alternative**: CRISPR/Cas9 clinical trials show 91% transfusion independence rate, offering potential one-time curative treatment
- **Emerging technology**: CRISPR is relatively new and not yet available in Indonesia, warranting research on its future potential

## TL;DR

**Hypothesis Confirmed**: CRISPR/Cas9 is effective as a future treatment option for thalassemia in Indonesia

**Current Challenges**: High cost ($2.2M USD/patient) and off-target effect risks require further refinement
